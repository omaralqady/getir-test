### To run the app for the first time:
1. Create `.env` file with `DB_URI` value to connect to an external DB
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run start`


### To run in dev mode (restarting with `nodemon`):
`npm run dev`



N.B.: In a normal production app, I would use a proper logging library as opposed to using `console.log`
